You will need a github account, and some basic understanding of git

To suggest changes:
- Open the Github view (under window)
- Select branches, and then the branch you wish to suggest changes to (probably master)
- Click 'New Branch' in the upper right corner of the github view
- Enter a name, and switch to it by right clicking on it, and selecting switch
- Make changes, commit them on the changes tab (this guide may help: https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/blob/master/docs/using/quick-guide.md)

- Open up github in your browser, and open a pull request from your branch to the branch you want to change

I will review pull requests, and pull them if they introduce good changes.
