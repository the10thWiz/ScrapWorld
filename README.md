# ScrapWorld
The ScrapWorld Game

This repository will hold the entirety of the ScrapWorld Unity project.

You will need a github account, and some basic understanding of git
Guide to github for unity: https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/blob/master/docs/using/quick-guide.md
Github guide: https://help.github.com/

To suggest changes:
- Open the Github view (under window)
- Select branches, and then the branch you wish to suggest changes to (probably master)
- Click 'New Branch' in the upper right corner of the github view
- Enter a name, and switch to it by right clicking on it, and selecting switch
- Make changes, commit them on the changes tab (this guide may help: https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/blob/master/docs/using/quick-guide.md)
- Push to github
- Open up github in your browser, and open a pull request from your branch to the branch you want to change

I will review pull requests, and pull them if they introduce good changes.

# Naming conventions

Every file name should be lowercare, using underscores (`_`) to show different versions of the same file, and include a \_1 at the end, unless it is a second version of the same file (then the one becomes 2, etc)
e.g.
- robot_1.png = a png of a robot (the first one file with this name)
- robot_rusty_2.png = a png of the same robot, but rusty (the second one file with this name)
